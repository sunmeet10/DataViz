**Introduction**


We have used a dataset of different types of cars and trucks. Specifications are given for 427 new vehicles for the year 2004. The attributes include price, fuel efficiency, quantitative measurements relating to the size of the vehicle. 
In this dataset, we have 427 observations with 27 variables.

Dataset Analysis:
We have created a dashboard in Python that links all our visualizations and analysis.

To understand, let’s look at the individual aspects of the dashboard
1.	Horse power vs Retail price($): 
This scatter plots compares the horse power and retail price of each  vehicle.

2.	Number of cars of each company:
This bar graph gives number of records of different companies. Toyota, Mercedes and Chevrolet have the high number of records. On selecting each record the dashboard highlights the features of the particular company.

3.	Country wise analysis: 
This graph gives the country of the vehicle name along with the retail price. It is known that Germany, USA and Japan are leading manufacturers of cars. These countries manufacture cars for all price ranges. You can find maximum diversity for these countries.

4.	Type of vehicle analysis: 
From the dataset, we also get the type of vehicle. They can be classified into Wagon, Sports Car, Sedan, SUV, Pickup and Minivan.

5.	Analysis on the factors that affect the price of the vehicle:
In order to analyse the factors affecting the price of the vehicle, we have plotted Cylinder, Engine Size,  City Miles per gallon, Highway Miles per gallon, Wheel base, Len, Weight and Width.

Actions and analysis on the dashboard: 
Selecting a single company: The dashboard highlights the graphs filtered for ex. Mercedes.
